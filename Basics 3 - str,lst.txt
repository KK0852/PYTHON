1.Strings in Python 
            A string is a sequence of characters. It can be declared in 
python by using double-quotes. Strings are immutable, i.e., they cannot be changed.

eg:
# Assigning string to a variable
a = "This is a string"
print (a)


2.Lists in Python 
          Lists are one of the most powerful tools in python. They are just like the arrays declared in other languages. 
But the most powerful thing is that list need not be always homogeneous. 
A single list can contain strings, integers, as well as objects.
 Lists can also be used for implementing stacks and queues. Lists are mutable, 
i.e., they can be altered once declared.

eg:
# Declaring a list
L = [1, "a" , "string" , 1+2]
print L
L.append(6)
print L
L.pop()
print L
print L[1]


3.Tuples in Python 
                A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. 
Tuples are just like lists with the exception that tuples cannot be changed once declared.
 Tuples are usually faster than lists.

eg:
tup = (1, "a", "string", 1+2)
print(tup)
print(tup[1])


4.Iterations in Python 
      Iterations or looping can be performed in python by ‘for’ and ‘while’ loops.
 Apart from iterating upon a particular condition, we can also iterate on strings, lists, 
and tuples.
Example 1: Iteration by while loop for a condition

eg1:
i = 1
while (i < 10):
	print(i)
	i += 1

eg2:
s = "Hello World"
for i in s :
	print (i)


eg3:
for i in range(0, 10):
	print (i)
